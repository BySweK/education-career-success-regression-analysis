# Education & Career Success – Regression Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between education background, career-related factors, and success metrics using regression-based machine learning models.

The main objective is to build **high-performing regression models** and understand how well selected features explain different career outcomes.

Two target variables are analyzed:
- **Starting Salary**
- **Career Satisfaction**

---

## 🧱 Project Workflow

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Regression model training
- Model evaluation
- Interpretation of model results

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Model Performance

The regression models achieved **strong performance**, indicating that the selected features effectively explain the target variables.

Evaluation metrics used:
- R² Score

Compared to other regression experiments, this dataset better satisfies linear regression assumptions, leading to improved model accuracy and interpretability.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Education and career-related features show strong relationships with success metrics
- The same feature set can behave differently depending on the target variable
- Career satisfaction is more predictable than salary using the given features
- Proper feature selection significantly improves regression performance

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

- Only linear regression models were applied
- Additional models such as Ridge or Lasso regression can be explored
- Non-linear models could further improve performance in future studies
